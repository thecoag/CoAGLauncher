CoAG Launcher is a custom open source Minecraft launcher written from the ground up in electron/react. Its main goal is to make it easy and enjoyable to manage different Minecraft versions and servers, bringing the playing and modding experience to the next level!

## üé® Features (Working on)

- Java Autorunner. You don't need to have java installed, a suitable version will be downloaded automatically.
- Easy installation. It's as easy as pie to install both the vanilla game and forge. No further action from the user is required.
- Built-in autoupdater. You will never need to download a new version manually.
- Vanilla, Forge, and Curse modpacks download.
- Built-in manager for Minecraft servers.

You can also:

- Import and export modpacks from and to other CoAG launchers
- Drag and drop instances wherever you like them, just like in your desktop
- Keep track of the time you played each instance
- Add instances to the download queue, they will automatically download one after the other
